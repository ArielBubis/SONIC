# Music Visualization and Recommendation System
## Overview
A comprehensive audio processing pipeline that transforms music files into visual representations for machine learning-based music recommendation. Part of a Recommender Systems course project, this tool generates multi-dimensional audio visualizations to enable image-based music categorization and analysis.
## Dataset
*Dataset Credit*: Music4All Dataset

Special thanks to the original dataset creators for providing the music collection used in this research.
## Key Features

Multi-threaded audio file processing
Four advanced audio visualization techniques:

* Mel Spectrograms
* Chromagrams
* FFT Spectra
* Tempograms


Optimized performance with parallel processing
Flexible configuration for audio analysis

## Visualizations
The pipeline creates rich, informative visual representations of audio files:

* Mel Spectrograms: Frequency-based energy distribution
* Chromagrams: Harmonic and tonal content
* FFT Spectra: Frequency amplitude analysis
* Tempograms: Rhythmic pattern visualization

## Purpose
Transform audio data into machine learning-ready image datasets for:

* Music genre classification
* Recommendation system training
* Advanced audio feature extraction

## Technologies

* Python 
* librosa
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* OpenCV
* Multiprocessing

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies
2. Configure input/output directories
3. Run the audio visualization script

Developed as part of a Recommender Systems course project.
